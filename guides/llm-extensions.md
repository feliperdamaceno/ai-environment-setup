## VS Code Extensions

This setup requires two distinct extensions:

### Continue

[Continue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)
is a VSCode extension that provides code completion, debugging, refactoring,
linting, formatting features and more. Once installed, you can copy
[config.yaml](../config/config.yaml) into your local configuration in
`~/.continue/config.yaml`.

### Cline

[Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev)
is a VSCode extension that provides multi-file editing features as well as
running commands from the Command Line Interface (CLI). Once installed, head
over to the extension settings and configure to use
`deepseek-r1:8b-llama-distill-q4_K_M` model from **Ollama**.
